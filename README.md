# Advent-of-Code-2018

## About
This is just a repository to store my solutions to the 2018 Advent of Code challenges. It's my first year attempting this, and I'm learning as I go so ideally my solutions for the problems towards the end of the program will be noticeably better than my solutions for those towards the beginning. I've sorted each day into a particular folder with an input.txt file holding the input for the problems of that day.
